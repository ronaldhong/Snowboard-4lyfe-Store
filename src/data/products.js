    name: "Rome Lo-Fi Rocker Snowboard - Women's",
    title: "An equal opportunity ripper, from peak to park.",
    description: "Strap into the Rome Women's Lo-Fi Rocker Snowboard if you don't discriminate between sending big jumps in the park and slashing fresh powder in the trees. This poppy, yet playful freestyle deck features balanced twin geometry for riding switch without compromise in the park. However, just because the Lo-Fi Rocker excels at jumps and jibs doesn't mean it can't slay the entire mountain. It's equally adept at dropping into open bowls and dicing up deep glades on powder days thanks to its FreePop Rocker.",

    name: "Phil Frost × G Pen × Burton Barracuda Snowboard",
    title: "An exclusive collaboration between Burton, Phil Frost, and G Pen.",
    description: "A board that can't be contained by terrain or conditions, the highly versatile Burton Barracuda harnesses freeride-focused Directional Flying V™ and a slight taper to bring Fish-like float to the entire mountain. Not as pow-specific as the Fish or as freestyle-focused as the Trick Pony, this ATV pushes the boundaries of freeride into an entirely different realm of straight shots and pillow lines. With all-wheel drive Frostbite Edges, the snap and stability of Squeezebox core profiling, and a snappier feel thanks to the Carbon I-Beam™ upgrade, this top predator is the one to reach for in variable or unknown terrain.",

Fight power with power by charging the entire mountain on the Darkside.

    name: "Burton Genie Snowboard",
    title: "No, a genie won’t pop out and teach you how to ride, but this board is built to grant you one wish: to cruise the hill with confidence.",
    description:"Hands down the easiest board out there, the Burton Genie is perfect for aspiring riders looking to build a foundation before moving on to a more performance-oriented deck like the Feather. Like stepping on a magic carpet, the Genie silences your fears, magically teaching balance and board control from the first time you strap in. Easy Bevel combines a soft, mellow flex with a convex base for a virtually-catch free riding experience, while Flat Top and a true twin shape provide a stable platform that's effortlessly maneuverable no matter which way you point it. The Channel™ mounting system gives you the easiest, most adjustable setup with any binding out there (not just Burton’s).",
